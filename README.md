Net dollar retention (NDR) or Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is a SaaS metric to see the fluctuations within the existing revenue base. NDR is used to further describe the changes in recurring revenue over time according to upgrades, downgrades, and churn. In other words, NDR tells you how much revenue growth or churn you have in a period of time from your existing customers.

It’s a crucial metric that shows you your success in achieving growth without acquiring new customers.

NDR = (Revenue at the start + upgrades – downgrades – churn) / Revenue at the start
